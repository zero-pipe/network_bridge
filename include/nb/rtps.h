/*
 * RTPS transport provider backed by the in-tree RTPS implementation.
 *
 * Register the provider before creating any node, then use a binding URI:
 *   rtps://<domain>                           multicast discovery, ephemeral ports
 *   rtps://<domain>:<spdp-port>               unicast only, fixed discovery port
 *   rtps://<domain>:<port>/<host>:<port>,...  explicit unicast peers
 *
 * A port or peer list disables multicast, because both pin discovery to
 * explicit endpoints. The default bind address is 0.0.0.0; set the advertise
 * address through the participant configuration when the host has several
 * interfaces.
 *
 * Topics are derived from the full "Service.method" route the same way as the
 * Cyclone provider:
 *   <Service>_<method>_req  request topic
 *   <Service>_<method>_res  response topic
 *   <Service>_<method>_evt  one-way event / pub-sub topic
 *
 * QoS is taken from nb_binding_config_t.qos (or the inherited transport.qos);
 * reliability, durability, history depth and partition are mapped onto the
 * participant's endpoint policies.
