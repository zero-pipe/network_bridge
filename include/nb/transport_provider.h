 *     provider that retains the frame must take its own reference with
 *     nb_buf_ref() and release it later; otherwise the core releases it as soon
 *     as the callback returns.
 *   - reply_token is opaque, belongs to the provider, and is valid only during
 *     on_receive and later ops->reply calls for that same inbound message.
 *   - message->peer is the provider-filled source endpoint and is callback
 *     scoped; message->target is the core-filled destination for send().
